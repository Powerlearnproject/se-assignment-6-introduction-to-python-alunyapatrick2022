# SE-Assignment-6

Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Answers:

1. Python Basics:

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is widely used in a variety of applications.

Some of its key features that make it popular among developers include:

- Simplicity and Readability:
  Python has a clean and intuitive syntax, making it easy to read and write code. This makes it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.

- Versatility:
  Python can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, scientific computing, automation, and more.

- Cross-platform Compatibility\:
  Python programs can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, without the need for major modifications.

- Large Standard Library:
  Python comes with a vast standard library that provides a wide range of functionalities, reducing the need to write boilerplate code.

- Dynamic Typing:
  Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means that variables can hold values of different data types without the need for explicit declarations.

Use cases where Python is particularly effective include:

- Data Science and Machine Learning:
  Python's powerful data analysis and machine learning libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, make it a popular choice for these domains.

- Web Development:
  Python's web frameworks like Django and Flask are widely used for building web applications.

- Automation and Scripting:
  Python's readability and extensive library support make it an excellent choice for automating tasks and writing system scripts.

- Scientific Computing:
  Python's scientific computing libraries, such as NumPy and SciPy, are widely used in the fields of physics, mathematics, and engineering.

2. Installing Python:

The steps to install Python on different operating systems are as follows:

Windows:

1. Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for Windows.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
3. To verify the installation, open the Windows Command Prompt and type `python --version`. This should display the installed version of Python.
4. To set up a virtual environment, you can use the built-in `venv` module. Open the Command Prompt, navigate to your project directory, and run `python -m venv env` to create a new virtual environment. Then, activate the virtual environment by running `env\Scripts\activate`.

macOS:

1. Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for macOS.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
3. To verify the installation, open the Terminal and type `python3 --version`. This should display the installed version of Python.
4. To set up a virtual environment, you can use the built-in `venv` module. Open the Terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run `python3 -m venv env` to create a new virtual environment. Then, activate the virtual environment by running `source env/bin/activate`.

Linux:

1. Open the terminal and check if Python is already installed by running `python3 --version`. If not, install Python using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt-get install python3`.
2. To verify the installation, run `python3 --version` in the terminal.
3. To set up a virtual environment, you can use the built-in `venv` module. Open the terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run `python3 -m venv env` to create a new virtual environment. Then, activate the virtual environment by running `source env/bin/activate`.

4. Python Syntax and Semantics:

Here's a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

print("Hello, World!")

The basic syntax elements used in this program are:

1. `print()`: This is a built-in function in Python that is used to display output to the console.
2. `"Hello, World!"`: This is a string literal, which is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.

3. Data Types and Variables:

The basic data types in Python are:

- Numeric: `int`, `float`, `complex`
- Text: `str`
- Boolean: `bool`
- Sequence: `list`, `tuple`, `range`
- Mapping: `dict`
- Set: `set`, `frozenset`

Here's a script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types:

age = 30
print(age) # Output: 30

# Float

pi = 3.14159
print(pi) # Output: 3.14159

# String

name = "John Doe"
print(name) # Output: John Doe

# Boolean

is_student = True
print(is_student) # Output: True

# List

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Dictionary

person = {
"name": "John Doe",
"age": 30,
"city": "New York"
}
print(person) # Output: {'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

5. Control Structures:

Conditional statements in Python use the `if-elif-else` syntax. Here's an example:

age = 18
if age < 18:
print("You are a minor.")
elif age >= 18 and age < 21:
print("You are an adult, but not of legal drinking age.")
else:
print("You are an adult and of legal drinking age.")

Loops in Python can be implemented using the `for` and `while` statements. Here's an example of a `for` loop:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
print(num)

This loop will iterate through the `numbers` list and print each value.

6. Functions in Python:

Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword. They can take arguments and return values. Here's an example of a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:

def add_numbers(a, b):
return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result) # Output: 8

In this example, the `add_numbers()` function takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum. The function is then called with the arguments `5` and `3`, and the result is stored in the `result` variable, which is then printed.

7. Lists and Dictionaries:

Lists in Python are ordered collections of items, while dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Here's an example script that demonstrates the use of both:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[0]) # Output: 1
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

person = {
"name": "John Doe",
"age": 30,
"city": "New York"
}
print(person) # Output: {'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
print(person["name"]) # Output: John Doe
person["occupation"] = "Software Engineer"
print(person) # Output: {'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York', 'occupation': 'Software Engineer'}

8. Exception Handling:

Exception handling in Python is done using the `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks. Here's an example:

try:
result = 10 / 0 # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
print("Error: Division by zero")
finally:
print("This block will always execute, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.")

In this example, the `try` block attempts to divide 10 by 0, which will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. The `except` block catches

# Submission Guidelines:
